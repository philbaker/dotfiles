# Neovim config with Fennel

```bash
# Delete the current nvim config
rm -rf $HOME/.config/nvim

# Make a symbolic link to new config
ln -sf $PWD/nvim $HOME/.config/nvim
```

On first load Neovim will download Packer and Aniseed. It will show a few errors which can be ignored for now. The next step is to install plugins with `:PackerInstall`.
